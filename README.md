# DAM-Configuration-Moving-Tools

This is a set of tools that can help you automate moving certain DAM configuration objects from one Aprimo envoronment to another. 

The scope of objects these tools can help you with is this:

- Classifications,
- Field Groups,
- Field Definitions,
- Settings,
- Rules,
- File Types,
- User Group creation with Domain Rights assigned,
- Classification Permissions,
- Functional DAM permissions

This tooling therefore does not cover all aspects of configuration deployment, some of the configuration pieces you will have to manage separately. For more information of how tool runs and best practices when performing DAM configuration deployments, refer to documents in folder Documentation.
